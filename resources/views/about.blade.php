            <h2>PHP</h2></center><br> (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. Created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has grown to become one of the foundational technologies for building dynamic websites and web applications.
           <h3> Key Features of PHP</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Server-Side Scripting: PHP scripts are executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client as plain HTML. This allows for the creation of dynamic web pages that can interact with databases and perform complex calculations.</li>

    <li>Easy to Learn: PHP's syntax is easy to grasp for beginners, especially those with a background in programming. Its similarity to C, Java, and Perl makes it accessible for many developers.</li>

    <li>Cross-Platform: PHP runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS. It is compatible with almost all servers used today (e.g., Apache, IIS).</li>

    <li>Integration: PHP can be embedded within HTML or combined with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. It seamlessly integrates with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and others.</li>

    <li>Large Community and Ecosystem: With a vast community of developers, PHP boasts a wealth of resources, libraries, and frameworks (like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter) that facilitate development and reduce the time to build robust applications.</li>
